            As a passionate and versatile professional with a B.Sc in Cell and Molecular Biology and a bootcamp in full-stack web development, I am excited to transition into a field that offers constant new tasks, challenges and opportunities for growth. Through my work as a lab technician, I honed my attention to detail, multitasking and working effectively in a team-based environment. Seeing the potential of emerging technology in various industries, I pursued web development. This allowed me to acquire proficiency in various skills for both front-end and back-end development. I look forward to contributing my diverse skill set and passion for science and technology to a team that values continual learning and the pursuit of helpful outcomes for others.
